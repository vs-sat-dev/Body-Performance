# Body-performance

Test task with "Body Performance" dataset which supposes make Exploratory Data Analysis, make visualization using seaborn and matplotlib, find feature with the highest correlation, create XGBoost model(allowed only XGBoost) to this dataset and create flask/fast api application which would take user input and return model prediction.


During solving these tasks I actively used the internet.
